# PHP-API-Demo-Project
This sample implementation shows how to use the mailworx API with PHP. (http://www.mailworx.info)

Use this code to see how you can work with the http://www.mailworx.info/api API.
Take a look at the website for additional reading and description of the API. There you see all available methods and functionality.

To use the api you need a valid mailworx login and a registered api client. You can register the client here: https://www.mailworx.info/de/api/schnittstelle-erstellen

Have fun with this code.
